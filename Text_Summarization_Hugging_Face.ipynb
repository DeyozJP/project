              "\"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The people of the United States consider the national \\n        and international protection and promotion of human rights and \\n        the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The \\n        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill \\n        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and \\n        protection in the Constitution.\\n            (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents \\n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are \\n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \\n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \\n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \\n        citizens of the United States.\\n            (3) The United States will continue to receive requests \\n        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human \\n        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. \\n        In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish \\n        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the \\n        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. \\n        Currently, the United States responds to declassification \\n        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential \\n        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of \\n        the United States in the protection and promotion of human \\n        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant \\n        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, \\n        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \\n        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').\\n            (4) The expedient declassification of human rights \\n        documents in full compliance with United States security \\n        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will \\n        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law \\n        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of \\n        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of \\n        Government resources.\\n            (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \\n        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States \\n        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military \\n        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, \\n        consistent with the national interests and international \\n        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless \\n        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and \\n        citizens of the United States promote human rights and \\n        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if \\n        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken \\n        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed \\n        United States engagements in those areas remains.\\n            (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \\n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \\n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \\n        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a \\n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \\n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \\n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \\n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.\\n            (7) The United States has long provided international \\n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \\n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \\n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \\n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \\n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \\n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\\n            (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against \\n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \\nPunishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one \\nanother the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \\nproceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or \\ncomplicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at \\ntheir disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a \\nmember State of the Organization of American States, the United States \\nshould seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the \\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the \\nOrganization of American States adopt legislative and such other \\nmeasures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to \\ninformation in files and documents in the power of the State, \\nparticularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal \\nresponsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human \\nrights.''\\n            (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \\n        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and \\n        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission \\n        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and \\n        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \\n        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \\n        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, \\n        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human \\n        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the \\n        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification \\n        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal \\n        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan \\n        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, \\n        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the \\n        relatives.''\\n            (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, \\n        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery \\n        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the \\n        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.\\n            (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, \\n        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I \\n        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence \\n        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the \\n        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] \\n        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. \\n        We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace \\n        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''\\n            (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \\n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting \\n        documentation of the United States on human rights violations \\n        in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request \\n        has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \\n        means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \\n        United States Government containing information about gross \\n        violations of internationally recognized human rights committed \\n        after 1944.\\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \\n        United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \\n        policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, \\n        the Department of State, the Agency for International \\n        Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its \\n        components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \\n        Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of \\n        its components), the National Security Council, and the \\n        Executive Office of the President.\\n            (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human \\n        rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally \\n        recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in \\n        section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \\n        U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).\\n\\nSEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS \\n              RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \\nprovisions of this Act shall govern the declassification and public \\ndisclosure of human rights records by agencies.\\n    (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the \\ndate of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and \\norganize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in \\nGuatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and \\ndisclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, \\nall records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available \\nto the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section \\nis completed.\\n    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of \\nenactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding \\neach agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.\\n\\nSEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a \\nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \\nonly if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing \\nevidence that--\\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \\n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \\n        States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record \\n        is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and \\n        such public disclosure would reveal--\\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently \\n                requires protection;\\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \\n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \\n                        Government;\\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \\n                        disclosed; and\\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \\n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \\n                        activities; or\\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \\n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \\n                of foreign relations of the United States, the \\n                disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the \\n                national security of the \\n                United States;\\n            (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided \\n        confidential information to the United States and would pose a \\n        substantial risk of harm to that individual;\\n            (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could \\n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \\n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so \\n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\\n            (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would \\n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \\n        currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a \\n        cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public \\n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \\n        interest.\\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \\ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \\nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \\nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \\nrelationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection \\n(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an \\n``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \\n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\\n\\nSEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN \\n              OTHER COUNTRIES.\\n\\n    In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request \\nfor human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations, \\nthe Organization of American States or a similar entity, a national \\ntruth commission or entity of similar nature, or from the principal \\njustice or human rights official of a country that is investigating a \\npattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, \\nthe agency shall conduct a review of records as described in section 4 \\nand shall declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance \\nwith the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.\\n\\nSEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS.\\n\\n    (a) Duties of the Appeals Panel.--The Interagency Security \\nClassification Appeals Panel or any other entity subsequently \\nestablished by law or Executive order and charged with carrying out the \\nfunctions currently carried out by such Panel (referred to in this Act \\nas the ``Appeals Panel'') shall review all determinations by an agency \\nto postpone public disclosure of any human rights record.\\n    (b) Determinations of the Appeals Panel.--\\n            (1) In general.--The Appeals Panel shall direct that all \\n        human rights records be disclosed to the public, unless the \\n        Appeals Panel determines that there is clear and convincing \\n        evidence that--\\n                    (A) the record is not a human rights record; or\\n                    (B) the human rights record or particular \\n                information in the human rights record qualifies for \\n                postponement of disclosure pursuant to section 5.\\n            (2) Treatment in cases of nondisclosure.--If the Appeals \\n        Panel concurs with an agency decision to postpone disclosure of \\n        a human rights record, the Appeals Panel shall determine, in \\n        consultation with the originating agency and consistent with \\nthe standards set forth in this Act, which, if any, of the alternative \\nforms of disclosure described in paragraph (3) shall be made by the \\nagency.\\n            (3) Alternative forms of disclosure.--The forms of \\n        disclosure described in this paragraph are as follows:\\n                    (A) Disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion \\n                of the human rights record after deletion of the \\n                portions described in paragraph (1).\\n                    (B) Disclosure of a record that is a substitute for \\n                information which is not disclosed.\\n                    (C) Disclosure of a summary of the information \\n                contained in the human rights record.\\n            (4) Notification of determination.--\\n                    (A) In general.--Upon completion of its review, the \\n                Appeals Panel shall notify the head of the agency in \\n                control or possession of the human rights record that \\n                was the subject of the review of its determination and \\n                shall, not later than 14 days after the determination, \\n                publish the determination in the Federal Register.\\n                    (B) Notice to president.--The Appeals Panel shall \\n                notify the President of its determination. The notice \\n                shall contain a written unclassified justification for \\n                its determination, including an explanation of the \\n                application of the standards contained in section 5.\\n            (5) General procedures.--The Appeals Panel shall publish in \\n        the Federal Register guidelines regarding its policy and \\n        procedures for adjudicating appeals.\\n    (c) Presidential Authority Over Appeals Panel Determination.--\\n            (1) Public disclosure or postponement of disclosure.--The \\n        President shall have the sole and nondelegable authority to \\n        review any determination of the Appeals Panel under this Act, \\n        and such review shall be based on the standards set forth in \\n        section 5.

SHORT TITLE.\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights History Project Act of \\n2009''.\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\\n        (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that \\n    individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight \\n    for justice.\\n        (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights \\n    movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of \\n    this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the \\n    Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March \\n    on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the \\n    March to Selma.\\n        (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, \\n    including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa \\n    Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just \\n    as important to the cause but who are not as well known.\\n        (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an \\n    invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, \\n    and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories \\n    will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an \\n    important and tumultuous period.\\n        (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project to \\n    collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights \\n    movement so future generations will be able to learn of their \\n    struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. \\n    A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the \\n    efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to \\n    collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil \\n    Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects \\n    undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the \\n    Nation.\\n        (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are \\n    appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available \\n    to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and \\n    Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation \\n    projects, and experience in the development of cultural and \\n    educational programs for the public.\\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \\nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \\ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \\nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who \\nparticipated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon \\nand complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, \\nand to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of \\nsuch individuals so that Americans of all current and future \\ngenerations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the \\nsacrifices they made.\\nSEC. 3.

Existing law defines a dependent for these purposes as including the employee\\u2019s spouse and all children from birth until 26 years of age, or a child 26 years of age or older who is both incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of intellectual disability or physical handicap and chiefly dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance, as specified.\\nThis bill would clarify that for dependent children over the age of majority the group policyholder would be authorized to elect coverage at age variations up to the limiting age.\\nExisting law defines a waiver of premium benefit or a waiver of monthly deduction benefit under a life insurance contract as a supplemental benefit that operates to safeguard a life insurance contract against lapse when the insured becomes totally disabled, as defined by the supplemental benefit, and continues until the end of the insured\\u2019s disability or the period specified by the supplemental benefit, consistent with specified restrictions. Existing law requires, if the insured\\u2019s total disability begins before the insured attains 60 years of age, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled. Existing law requires, if the insured\\u2019s total disability begins when the insured is 60 years of age or older, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled up to 65 years of age.\\nThis bill would require an insurer, for an insured who becomes totally disabled before attaining 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit, to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period of total disability up to the time the insured attains 65 years of age. The bill would also permit an insurer to collect premiums or monthly deductions from an insured who becomes totally disabled on or after 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit. The bill would require an insurer offering a renewal for a group life insurance policy issued prior to January 1, 2017, that contains a supplemental benefit to offer the employer a continuation of the in-force supplemental benefit, and would authorize the insurer to concurrently offer the group policyholder the option to change the supplemental benefit to either waive or collect premiums or monthly deductions as described above.\",\n          \"Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.\\nUnder the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree and who was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B Entitlement award, receives a Cal Grant A or B award if, at the time of the transfer, the student meets specified requirements, among which is a requirement that the student not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year.\\nThis bill would provide that the requirement that a student not be 28 years or older by December 31 of the award year, as described above, would not apply to a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States, as defined, who was seeking a Cal Grant A or B award under this provision, unless he or she is a former member who received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge. The bill would prohibit a qualifying institution from accepting award funds under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program and Title 38 of the United States Code in the same award year for a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is 28 years of age or older.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1201,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An act to add Part 16 (commencing with Section 54000) to Division 31 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to housing, by providing the funds necessary therefor through an election for the issuance and sale of bonds of the State of California and for the handling and disposition of those funds, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.\",\n          \"An act to amend\\nSection 19605\\nSections 19605 and 19620.2\\nof the Business and Professions Code,\\nand to amend Section 3200 of the Food and Agricultural Code,\\nrelating to horse\\nracing.\\nracing, and making an appropriation therefor.\",\n          \"An act to amend Sections 905.2, 8590.6, and 15820.946 of, and to add Section 15820.947 to, the Government Code, and to amend Section 37001.5 of, and to repeal Section 43011.3 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to state government, and making an appropriation therefor, to take effect immediately, bill related to the budget.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SHORT TITLE.\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights History Project Act of \\n2009''.\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\\n        (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that \\n    individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight \\n    for justice.\\n        (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights \\n    movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of \\n    this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the \\n    Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March \\n    on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the \\n    March to Selma.\\n        (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, \\n    including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa \\n    Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just \\n    as important to the cause but who are not as well known.\\n        (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an \\n    invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, \\n    and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories \\n    will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an \\n    important and tumultuous period.\\n        (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project to \\n    collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights \\n    movement so future generations will be able to learn of their \\n    struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. \\n    A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the \\n    efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to \\n    collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil \\n    Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects \\n    undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the \\n    Nation.\\n        (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are \\n    appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available \\n    to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and \\n    Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation \\n    projects, and experience in the development of cultural and \\n    educational programs for the public.\\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \\nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \\ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \\nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who \\nparticipated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon \\nand complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, \\nand to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of \\nsuch individuals so that Americans of all current and future \\ngenerations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the \\nsacrifices they made.\\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT PROJECT AT LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND \\nNATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE TO COLLECT \\nVIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDINGS OF HISTORIES OF PARTICIPANTS IN AMERICAN \\nCIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.\\n    (a) Establishment of Project.--\\n        (1) In general.--Within the limits of available funds, the \\n    Librarian of Congress (hereafter referred to as the ``Librarian'') \\n    and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (hereafter \\n    referred to as the ``Secretary)'', acting jointly, shall establish \\n    an oral history project--\\n            (A) to survey, during the initial phase of the project, \\n        collections of audio and video recordings of the reminiscences \\n        of participants in the Civil Rights movement that are housed in \\n        archives, libraries, museums, and other educational \\n        institutions, as well as ongoing documentary work, in order to \\n        augment and complement these endeavors and avoid duplication of \\n        effort;\\n            (B) to solicit, reproduce, and collect--\\n                (i) video and audio recordings of personal histories \\n            and testimonials of individuals who participated in the \\n            Civil Rights movement, and\\n                (ii) visual and written materials (such as letters, \\n            diaries, photographs, and ephemera) relevant to the \\n            personal histories of individuals;\\n            (C) to create a collection of the recordings and other \\n        materials obtained, and to catalog and index the collection in \\n        a manner the Librarian and the Secretary consider appropriate; \\n        and\\n            (D) to make the collection available for public use through \\n        the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African \\n        American History and Culture, as well as through such other \\n        methods as the Librarian and the Secretary consider \\n        appropriate.\\n        (2) Role of director of museum.--The Secretary shall carry out \\n    the Secretary's duties under this Act through the Director of the \\n    National Museum of African American History and Culture.\\n    (b) Use of and Consultation With Other Entities.--The Librarian and \\nthe Secretary may carry out the activities described in subsection \\n(a)(1) through agreements and partnerships entered into with other \\ngovernment and private entities, and may otherwise consult with \\ninterested persons (within the limits of available resources) and \\ndevelop appropriate guidelines and arrangements for soliciting, \\nacquiring, and making available recordings under the project under this \\nAct.\\n    (c) Services of Experts and Consultants; Acceptance of Volunteer \\nServices; Advance Payments.--In carrying out activities described in \\nsubsection (a)(1), the Librarian and the Secretary may--\\n        (1) procure temporary and intermittent services under section \\n    3109 of title 5, United States Code;\\n        (2) accept and utilize the services of volunteers and other \\n    uncompensated personnel and reimburse them for travel expenses, \\n    including per diem, as authorized under section 5703 of title 5, \\n    United States Code; and\\n        (3) make advances of money and payments in advance in \\n    accordance with section 3324 of title 31, United States Code.\\n    (d) Timing.--As soon as practicable after the enactment of this \\nAct, the Librarian and the Secretary shall begin collecting video and \\naudio recordings and other materials under subsection (a)(1), and shall \\nattempt to collect the first such recordings from the oldest \\nindividuals involved.\\n    (e) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``Civil Rights movement'' \\nmeans the movement to secure racial equality in the United States for \\nAfrican Americans that, focusing on the period 1954 through 1968, \\nchallenged the practice of racial segregation in the Nation and \\nachieved equal rights legislation for all American citizens.\\nSEC. 4. PRIVATE SUPPORT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY PROJECT.\\n    (a) Encouraging Solicitation and Acceptance of Donations.--The \\nLibrarian of Congress and the Secretary are encouraged to solicit and \\naccept donations of funds and in-kind contributions to support \\nactivities under section 3.\\n    (b) Dedication of Funds Provided to Library of Congress.--\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law--\\n        (1) any funds donated to the Librarian of Congress to support \\n    the activities of the Librarian under section 3 shall be deposited \\n    entirely into an account established for such purpose;\\n        (2) the funds contained in such account shall be used solely to \\n    support such activities; and\\n        (3) the Librarian of Congress may not deposit into such account \\n    any funds donated to the Librarian which are not donated for the \\n    exclusive purpose of supporting such activities.\\nSEC. 5.
